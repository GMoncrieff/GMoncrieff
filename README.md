### Hello / Howzit / Molo üëã

My name is Glenn Moncrieff and I am a *Geospatial Data Scientist* and *ML reseacher* based in Cape Town, South Africa.

My background is in geography and ecology, and nowadays I spend most of my time observing the earth with satellites and machine learning üõ∞Ô∏è

I train models and conduct research to analyse environmental data üåè

Most of my effort is focussed on addressing the biodiversity and climate crises and their impact in non-forest ecosystems. I am most comfortable coding in Python and R.

My research has looked at a range of environmental	issues like [mapping plant biomes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13367), [modelling water loss to invasive plants](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.14161), [rapidly detecting habitat loss in shurblands ](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/12/2766) or [forecasting post-fire vegetation recovery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092427162030143X). I also wrote about climate change impacts on African ecosystems in the Africa chapter of the latest [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/).

I like to see science turned into real-world applications and software that the community can use. So I spend most of my time turning research into packages or operational products. Some fun software that I have created or contributed to:

- [Global Renosterveld Watch](https://github.com/mgietzmann/global_renosterveld_watch): Deploys trained tensorflow models to GCP via Apache Beam to predict shrubland habitat loss .

- [hyper-iap](https://github.com/GMoncrieff/hyper-iap): A python module for mapping alien invasive plants from hyperspectral imagery using deep learning.
  
- [saeonobsr](https://github.com/GMoncrieff/saeonobsr): An R package to query and downloaded environmental data from the SAEON observations database

- [Ecological Monitoring and Management Application](https://github.com/AdamWilsonLab/emma_envdata): An environmental data processing pipeline for forecasting satellite observed postfire vegetation recovery


My time is currently primarily devoted to these projects

- üî• [Ecosystem Monitoring for Management Application](www.emma.eco)
 Combining Earth observations in situ observations, and Bayesian ecological forecasting models to characterise vegetation state and predict postfire recovery in a highly biodiverse shrublands. We are producing an operational system to support the decisions of land mangers and help them identify ecosystem degradation from a range of causes
-  üåà Mapping species and simulating virtual plants as part of NASAs first biodiversity focussed field camping, the [Biodiversity Survey of the Cape](https://bioscape.io). BioScape is collecting high resolution hyperspectral, thermal and Lidar data of the Cape Floristic Region to test the limits of what we can learn  about diversity from space.
